# covid_multimorbidity

This repository contains scripts, data, results, figures and reproducibility report for the "SARS-CoV-2 comorbidity" study. In this study, we identified all eQTL SNPs that are involved in ADH and ALDH gene regulation and explored whether they are associated with alcohol dependence, psychiatric disorders and cognition.

Python (version 3.6.9), R studio (version 1.3.959) was used to visualise results. Cytoscape (version 3.8.2) was used for visualising the STRING network. 

1. Cell type- and tissue-specific Hi-C data is available on GEO or ENCODE databases (Accessions: GSE87112, GSE126199, GSE105776, GSE134761, GSE141749)

2. RNA-seq and genotyping data (GTEx v8) for Brain - Cortex, Whole Blood, Artery - Coronary and Lung tissues are available via dbGaP access (phs000424.v8.p2).
