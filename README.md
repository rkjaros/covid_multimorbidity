# covid_multimorbidity

This repository contains scripts, data, results, figures and reproducibility report for the "SARS-CoV-2 comorbidity" study. In this study, we identified genomic variants, genes and biological pathways that provide putative causal mechanisms connecting inherited risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 and comorbidities for the first time.

Python (version 3.6.9), R studio (version 1.3.959) was used to visualise results. Cytoscape (version 3.8.2) was used for visualising the STRING network. 

1. Cell type- and tissue-specific Hi-C data is available on GEO or ENCODE databases (Accessions: GSE87112, GSE126199, GSE105776, GSE134761, GSE141749)

2. RNA-seq and genotyping data (GTEx v8) for Brain - Cortex, Whole Blood, Artery - Coronary and Lung tissues are available via dbGaP access (phs000424.v8.p2).
