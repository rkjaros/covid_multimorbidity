# covid_multimorbidity

This repository contains scripts, data, results, figures and reproducibility report for the "SARS-CoV-2 comorbidity" study. In this study, we identified genomic variants, genes and biological pathways that provide putative causal mechanisms connecting inherited risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 and comorbidities for the first time.

Python (version 3.6.9), R studio (version 1.3.959) was used to visualise results. Cytoscape (version 3.8.2) was used for visualising the STRING network. 

1. Cell type- and tissue-specific Hi-C data is available on [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) (Accessions: GSE87112, GSE126199, GSE105776, GSE134761, GSE141749)

2. RNA-seq and genotyping data (GTEx v8) for Brain - Cortex, Whole Blood, Artery - Coronary and Lung tissues are available via [dbGaP access](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000424.v8.p2) (phs000424.v8.p2).

3. Gene regulatory networks are available on figshare - [Brain](10.6084/m9.figshare.20205641); [Lung](10.6084/m9.figshare.20205644); [Whole  Blood](10.6084/m9.figshare.20205662); [Coronary Artery](10.6084/m9.figshare.20205647)
